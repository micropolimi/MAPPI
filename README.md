🚀 **Open Software & Hardware for Plant Imaging**

---

## 🌱 Overview
MAPPI (MAcroscopic Plant Projection Imaging) is an open-source project dedicated to advanced imaging of growing plants. It provides tools for:
✅ Software-controlled optical imaging using cameras and LEDs.
✅ Automated data analysis with region-of-interest (ROI) registration.
✅ Hardware integration for multiview plant growth monitoring.

## 🖥️ Software Installation
The control software for MAPPI is based on [Scope Foundry]. To set up the python environment and install the software:
1. Follow the [Scope Foundry installation] guidelines.
2. Download or clone the [MAPPI code], which runs cameras, LEDs, and controls triggers with a dedicated [App].

## ⚙️ Software Usage
By running the *plant_app* script, a new window appears on the screen, allowing control of the MAPPI system. All acquisition parameters can be configured through the *PlantTimeLapseDualMeasure* widget, located above the canvas. A detailed description of the options offered by the *PlantTimeLapseDualMeasure* is provided below.

1) **Time Lapse Number**: Number of time points to be acquired.
2) **Waiting Time**: Time interval between consecutive time points.
3) **X - Y LED**: When not measuring, ticking the checkbox toggles the selected LED on or off. Facilitates accurate positioning of the sample prior to measurement. 
4) **View**: Enables switching from one view to another.
5) **Acquisition Time**: Exposure time. Use 4) to select the appropriate channel and set the exposure time. Exposure time may differ between channels X and Y.
6) **AutoRange** and **AutoLevels**: When unchecked, these boxes allow the user to manually define the displayed portion of the Field of View and and set the grayscale level limits.
7) **Save H5**: When this checkbox is checked, pressing the Start button will save a new acquisition. 
8) **Start** and **Interrupt**: These two buttons start and stop the measurment respectively.
9) **Save Dr**: Directory where data will be saved.
10) **Sample**: Name of the file to be saved.
11) **State bar**: Displays the percentage of completed acquisitions.

## 📊 Data Analysis
For analyzing MAPPI datasets of growing plants, we recommend using the [napari ROI Registration plugin]. This plugin is specifically designed for time-lapse registration of regions-of-interest.

🔹 _Provides precise region tracking over time._   
🔹 _Easy-to-use with napari interface._

## 🛠️ Hardware Components
A list of all the components necessary to reproduce the MAPPI platform is available at the following [link].

---

## 🏗️ Hardware Installation
The MAPPI setup can be efficiently replicated by following the detailed step-by-step guide available [here].

---

## 🔬 3D-printed imaging chambers
Use MAPPI in combination with custom-made 3D-printed rhizoboxes to perform root imaging under near-physiological conditions.
